A complete PKCS#11 wrapper for Python.
You can use any PKCS#11 (aka CryptoKi) module such as the PSM which
comes as part of mozilla or the various modules supplied by vendors of
hardware crypto tokens, and almost all PKCS#11 functions and data types.
The wrapper has been generated with the help of the SWIG compiler.
